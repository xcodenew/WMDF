This Windows GUI tool provides a front end to extracting memory related artifacts with Volatility. Additionally, analysts can compare those collected artifacts with a whitelisted artifacts database (generated by running the tool against a baseline system) of their choice. This comparison points out the changes made by malware on the system, helps provide analysts with crisp and low level information, and decreases the area of investigation an analyst needs to manually review.

Our tool was also selected for final review for Volatility 2016 Contest.
